Faulty Calculator

Overview:

This project is a simple "Faulty Calculator" built using HTML and JavaScript. The application aims to provide the functionality of a calculator with an intentional twist: it introduces certain deliberate errors in calculations for specific cases. This is a fun way to explore JavaScript coding while adding an element of surprise to an otherwise straightforward tool.

Features:

Perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).

Introduce specific, intentional errors for certain inputs or operations.

Interactive interface for user input and results display.

Technologies Used:

HTML: To structure the web page.

JavaScript: To implement the calculator logic.

How to Use:

Open the index.html file in a web browser.

Enter values for your calculations.

Observe the results, including the deliberate "faults" for specific inputs or operations.

How It Works:

The project uses JavaScript to handle the arithmetic operations. Inside the script (index.js), certain conditions are hardcoded to produce incorrect outputs for selected cases. For example:

Multiplying two specific numbers might return a predefined incorrect result.

Dividing specific numbers could display an intentionally flawed output.

File Structure:

index.html: The main HTML file that hosts the calculator interface.

index.js: The JavaScript file containing the logic for the faulty calculator.
